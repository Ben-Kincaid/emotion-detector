# emotion-detector
A web application with face landmark and emotion detection - using Typescript with face-api.js

## About
`emotion-detector` came to mind when perusing for libraries that can handle purely client-side face detection. I remembered reading an article about Vincent Muhler's [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js) library. I saw that it came with baked-in functionality for emotion detection, as well as a clean API for sending the face landmark points for use in drawing on a `canvas`, making it flexible with how i visually represent the facial recognition. `face-api.js` is written in Typescript which persuaded me to try to dive a bit deeper with Typescript.
